# Hudson-Model
Rock-physics model to compute P and S-wave velocities in transversely isotropic cracked media. 

This model is used in  our paper: P- and S-Wave Velocities of Exhumed Metasediments From the Alaskan Subduction Zone: Implications for the In Situ Conditions Along the Megathrust
to determine compare our experimental Vp data to theoretical calculations of velocity. A link to the paper is available below.
